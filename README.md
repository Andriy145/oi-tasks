If you want to upload problem statements, you should:

1. Go to /statements/ folder
2. Go to the needed Olympiad folder
3. Create the folder of a year. For example, if you uploading IOI 2013, you need to create folder 2013 in /statements/ioi/
4. For each problem, create a folder. For example, if you have six problems, you should create six folders: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
5. In each folder, add pdfs of all translations. 

Each pdf file should follow the format ioi-2013-1-uk_UKR.pdf, in which
1. 'ioi' is the short name of the Olympiad (same as folder)
2. '2013' is the year of the Olympiad (same as folder)
3. '1' is the problem number (same as folder)
4. 'uk' is the language
5. 'UKR' is the country.

In each folder, there should be a file, which ends by 'en_ISC.pdf'. It defines the original statement.

You can find the list of all languages and countries in the file 'languages.json'.
